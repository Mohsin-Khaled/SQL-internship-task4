# üìä SQL Developer Internship - Task 4

This repository contains the solution for **Task 4: Aggregate Functions and Grouping** from the SQL Developer Internship program.

---

## üìù Task Overview
- **Objective**: Use aggregate functions and grouping to summarize data.
- **Tools**: MySQL Workbench
- **Deliverables**: SQL queries using `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`

## üìÇ Files in this Repository
- **sql-task-4.sql** ‚Üí SQL script containing table creation, sample data insertion, and aggregate queries.
- **Task Screenshot** ‚Üí Reference task description and requirements.

## üóÇÔ∏è Database & Table
The database created is **Business**, with a table named **Sales** having the following structure:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE Business;
USE Business;

CREATE TABLE Sales(
  id INT,
  region TEXT,
  salesperson TEXT,
  amount INT
);
```

## üì• Sample Data
The `Sales` table is populated with sample records:

```sql
INSERT INTO Sales(id, region, salesperson, amount)
VALUES 
(1, 'North', 'Jim', 1500),
(2, 'South', 'John', 1000),
(3, 'North', 'Max', NULL),
(4, 'East', 'Skylar', 1300),
(5, 'West', 'Angela', 2500),
(6, 'South', 'Farhan', 3000),
(7, 'East', 'Rose', 4000),
(2, 'South', 'John', 2000);
```

```sql
SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY region;
```

### 6. Salesperson Sales Above 2000 (Using HAVING)
```sql
SELECT salesperson, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY salesperson
HAVING SUM(amount) > 2000;

## üìå Key Learning Points
- `GROUP BY` is used to categorize data.
- `COUNT(*)` counts all rows, whereas `COUNT(column)` counts only non-null values.
- `HAVING` filters aggregated data, while `WHERE` filters before aggregation.
- Aggregate functions used: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`.
